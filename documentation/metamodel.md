# Metamodel

## Assumptions and Reasoning Model
This metamodel assumes the Open World Assumption (OWA). Under OWA, the absence of information does not imply the non-existence or falsehood of a relationship or attribute. Instead, it is assumed that the information may simply be incomplete. Consequently, validation processes will generate warnings, rather than errors, for instances that are potentially incomplete, allowing for deferred completion or specification.
